# 2. Is A2C considered an algorithm in the course and PPO not? YES
# 3. How long should we train the agent for?   !! find platue
# 4. In altering the action space, is it valid to somehow manipulate the actions where all actions are valid? YES - multiple methods, 1st 4, random 4, last 4, etc 
# 5. Observation space, should we just remove unecessary items from it? Duplicate and unused. (based off our environemnt - l2rpn_case14_sandbox) YES
# 6. Is changing algortihm paramters considered an iteration? NO (need more) - look at previous
